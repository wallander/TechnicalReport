Abstract:
  This package provides a flexible and easy interface to page dimensions.
  You can set the page layout with intuitive parameters. For instance,
  if you want to set a margin to 2cm from each edge of the paper,
  you can go \usepackage[margin=2cm]{geometry}. With \newgeometry command
  you can change the layout anywhere in the document.

CTAN: macros/latex/contrib/geometry
