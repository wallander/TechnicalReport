\section*{The \texttt{authoryear-comp} style}

This style is a compact version of the \texttt{authoryear} style
which prints the author only once if subsequent references passed to
a single citation command share the same author. If they share the
same year as well, the year is also printed only once. This style
will implicitly enable the \texttt{sortcites} package option at load
time.

\subsection*{Additional package options}

\subsubsection*{The \texttt{dashed} option}

By default, this style replaces recurrent authors/editors in the
bibliography by a dash so that items by the same author or editor
are visually grouped. This feature is controlled by the package
option \texttt{dashed}. Setting \texttt{dashed=false} in the
preamble will disable this feature. The default setting is
\texttt{dashed=true}.

\subsection*{Multiple citations}

\cite{knuth:ct:c,aristotle:physics,knuth:ct:b,aristotle:poetics,aristotle:rhetoric,knuth:ct:d}
