\chapter{Future work}

Some additions to the game were left out of the project scope, but should be added to increase the value of the finished game. The game that resulted from this project is playable in its current state, and it is, as stated before, an excellent basis to build a commercial game from. For those who would like to do that, there are some things that should be taken into consideration, because they were intentionally left out. These are fixed time steps, blabla, blabla and blabla, and are further explained below.
