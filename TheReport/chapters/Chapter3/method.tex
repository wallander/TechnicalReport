\subsection{Git versus SVN}

The decision to use Git instead of SVN was partly based on the fact that the group had greater experience using Git. Also, since Git allows the project to be stored locally on every members computer, work can be done on the implementation despite lack of internet access. This also means that any system failure is only going to affect one individual, who could then fetch an updated version of the project from the other members, providing the project with an increased tolerance to any system breakdowns. Other common reasons to use Git is that it uses less space, and completes its tasks faster, since it is quicker. 
While SVN's graphical user interfaces lends itself to a more speedy learningprocess, the amount of time needed to learn and utilize Git was not notable.
